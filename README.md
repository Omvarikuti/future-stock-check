# future-stock-check
This is a project that i made to be able to predict stocks on python.You can change the stock to something like intel by Changed ticker = 'NVDA' ➝ ticker = 'INTC'  Optionally, updated output filenames to reflect the new ticker for clarity (e.g., 'best_lstm_model.h5' ➝ 'best_lstm_model_intc.h5'), though this part is not strictly necessary.
